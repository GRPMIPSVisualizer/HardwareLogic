# Writing unit tests in TypeScript

In this story, we would be using TypeScript for unit testing along with popular frameworks: [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha)/[Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai), [Jasmine ](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine)or [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest). You have decided the framework and want to write unit tests in TypeScript, Great! We would walk through changes required to support unit tests in TypeScript. If not, documentation of each of this libraries can be referred. Writing test cases in TypeScript is very much same as it is in JavaScript. The most important part is to do setting up so that test cases written in TypeScript can be executed using this libraries.

*The source code is available at* [*https://github.com/chiragrupani/TSUnitTestsSetup*](https://github.com/chiragrupani/TSUnitTestsSetup)*. It contains setup and examples for each of these frameworks.*

The setup is very simple, we would install respective test framework and their types. We would be using [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) (for Mocha and jasmine) and [ts-jest ](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest)(for Jest) to add TypeScript support. We would be using [nyc ](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc)for code coverage.

We would follow the conventions: Place Source JS/TS files in `src` folder and tests typescript files in `tests` folder.

Basically, it is installation of *npm* packages for TypeScript, Test framework (e.g. Jasmine/Mocha/Jest) and specifying test script required to execute test cases as explained further. Along with selected unit test framework package, the corresponding types also required to be installed. For executing TS tests in Node, we need to specify `Scripts` for `test` in `package.json` . The `package.json` file is located under root of project and is generated when you execute `npm init`.

To debug TypeScript tests, the json specified under “VS Code debug” section below in the story need to be added under `configurations `in `launch.json` which can be created by going to Debug Menu and then Add Configuration in VS Code. Below are npm commands, test script and VS code debug recipe for each framework:

> **Mocha/Chai**

**NPM Install Command**

```
npm i -D chai mocha nyc ts-node typescriptnpm i -D @types/chai @types/mocha
```

**Test Script**

```
"scripts": {
    "test": "mocha -r ts-node/register tests/**/*.test.ts",    "coverage": "nyc -r lcov -e .ts -x \"*.test.ts\" npm run test"
}
```

**VS Code Debug**

```
{
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Mocha Current File",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha",
      "args": [
        "--no-timeouts",
        "--colors",
        "${file}",
        "--require",
        "ts-node/register"
      ],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "sourceMaps": true,
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
}
```

**Sample Test**

```
describe('calculate', function() {
  it('add', function() {
    let result = Calculator.Sum(5, 2);
    expect(result).equal(7);
  }); 
});
```

> **Jasmine**

**NPM Install Command**

```
npm i -D jasmine nyc ts-node typescriptnpm i -D @types/jasmine
```

**Test Script**

```
"scripts": {
  "test": "ts-node node_modules/jasmine/bin/jasmine --config=jasmine.json","coverage": "nyc -r text -e .ts -x \"tests/*.test.ts\" npm run test"}
```

The `jasmine.json` at root directory specifies path for tests like below:

```
{
   "spec_dir": "tests",
   "spec_files": ["**/*[tT]est.ts"]
}
```

**VS Code Debug**

```
{
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Jasmine Current File",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/jasmine/bin/jasmine",
      "args": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/TSOutput/tests/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.js"
      ],
      "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json",     
      "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/TSOutput/**/*.js"],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
}
```

**Sample Test**

```
describe('calculate', function() {
  it('add', function() {
    let result = Calculator.Sum(5, 2);
    expect(result).toBe(7);
  });
});
```

> **Jest**

**NPM Install Command**

```
npm i -D jest ts-jest typescriptnpm i -D @types/jest
```

**Test Script**

```
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",  "coverage": "jest --coverage"
}
```

**VS Code Debug**

```
{
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Jest Current File",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/jest",
      "args": ["${relativeFile}"],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen",
      "windows": {
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/jest/bin/jest"
      }
}
```

*Note:* Test script here is just “jest”. To use TypeScript, We define transform in new config `jest.config.js` file at location where `package.json `resides

```
module.exports = {
  transform: {'^.+\\.ts?$': 'ts-jest'},
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  testRegex: '/tests/.*\\.(test|spec)?\\.(ts|tsx)$',
  moduleFileExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'json', 'node']
};
```

The key is `testRegex` , where we are matching ts/tsx files ending with test/spec under tests folder. It will processed by `ts-jest` . We are using ‘node’ in ‘testEnvironment’ since we are executing tests on Node (which makes it faster), else we would be using default ‘jsdom’ value.

**Sample Test**

```
describe('calculate', function() {
  it('add', function() {
    let result = Calculator.Sum(5, 2);
    expect(result).toBe(7);   
});
```

That’s all required for set up, tests can be run by executing command:

```
npm t
```

`npm t` is shortcut for `npm run test` and for getting coverage results:

```
npm run coverage
```

> **Adding Test Case**

Before adding unit test cases, first let us understand Suite and Specs. **Spec** is each individual test case and contains one or many assertions. The test case passes when its expectations are true. It is generally defined (based on test framework) by using `**it**`functions. it contains two parameter — one is name of test case and other function containing assertion. **Suite** is group of related specs and generally defined using `**describe**` similar to `it` and contains many it functions. Sample test case above shows how it is defined for each of the framework.

Executing some code before (test initialization) and after (cleanup) each test cases, mocking external objects/services etc depends on framework, documentation for framework would contain required information.
